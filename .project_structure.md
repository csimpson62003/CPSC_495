# Clean Project Structure

## Root Files
- `inpaint.py` - Main inference script (provide image + mask, get inpainted result)
- `train_colab.py` - Training script for the model
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Usage instructions

## Directories
- `main/` - Core model components (U-Net, diffusion scheduler, dataset, etc.)
- `checkpoints/` - Saved model checkpoints
- `my_images/` - Place your images and masks here for inpainting
- `data/` - Training data directory

## Removed Items
✓ Deleted pattern-related files (pixel_pattern_dataset.py, test_patterns.py, train_patterns.py, test_pattern_inpainting.py)
✓ Deleted redundant scripts (inpaint_custom.py, test_model.py, check_checkpoint.py)
✓ Deleted test image directories (test_patterns/, my_images/, my_photos/)
✓ Deleted MNIST data directory

## Usage
1. Place image at: `my_images/image.png`
2. Place mask at: `my_images/mask.png` (white=keep, black=fill)
3. Run: `python inpaint.py`
